My name is King Law and I am currently a second year Ph.D. candidate at \
Ritsumeikan University studying Bioinformatics. My bioinformatics journey started \
in 2019 when I was accepted for an internship at Novozymes (now Novonesis) \
working on bacterial assemblies using different genome assemblers. \
After graduating from the University of California, Davis, in 2020, \
with a B.S. in Bioinformatics and a minor in Computer Science, \
I worked at SeqMatic, LLC, as a Bioinformatics Associate where I learned \
the technicalities of NGS libraries and quality control workflows in the \
wet lab from former Illumina scientists. Part of my job included talking \
with customers about project design, preparing NGS libraries from different \
source samples, and tailoring bioinformatics analysis according to the \
customer’s project. I left my job in 2022 to pursue graduate school at \
Ritsumeikan University to further my studies in bioinformatics.


This website will serve as my personal blog in which I write about subjects \
I’m learning about (wet laboratory techniques, statistical modeling, \
programming, and bioinformatics). Feel free to follow along on my journey \
to deepen my knowledge on Bioinformatics!
